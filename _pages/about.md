Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Agriculture, Food & Resource Economics (AFRE), with a dual major in Economics, at Michigan State University. I find joy in studying international trade 🚢, development economics 🍀, trade policy 🌐, and related issues. I love working with new data and picking up skills in data acquisition, manipulation, and analysis. At home, I share my space with two cats - Orange 🐈 and Blue 🐈‍⬛.
