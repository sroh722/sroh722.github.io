<summary>Abstract</summary>
This study examines the impact of intellectual property rights (IPR)-related trade policy on agri-food global value chains (GVCs). We use IPR provisions in regional trade agreements (RTAs) as a proxy for IPR-related trade policy. The empirical specification follows a gravity model. We explore the trade effects of IPR provisions based on their specific characteristics using the deep trade agreement data published by the World Bank. Additionally, the study analyzes the effects of IPR provisions by income pair group. The results indicate that average bilateral agricultural GVC trade participation decreases between members with RTAs containing IPR provisions compared to those without them. However, the effects vary by the type of IPR provisions. The findings suggest that interactive effects between different types of IPR provisions are crucial for enhancing agricultural and food GVC trade, while single-type IPR provisions have negative effects. These effects are more pronounced in the agriculture sector compared to the food sector and vary across income levels.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
With the spread of global agricultural value chains, international geopolitical risks often unintentionally trigger food insecurity in bystander countries. This study explores the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on wheat supplies in South Africa and their trade diversification. Using port-level trade data, we show that South Africa, the main distribution route for South African wheat supplies, rapidly diversified its imports to mitigate geopolitical risk in the aftermath of the war. This sudden import diversification prevented the war-induced decline in average wheat imports, yet it led to an increase in the volatility of annual imports. More importantly, the import diversification contributed to more secure wheat supplies for southern African landlocked countries that were heavily reliant on border imports from South Africa. Our study highlights that sourcing diversification in a country with well-developed port infrastructure could be instrumental in stave off food insecurity in neighboring countries in times of geopolitical crises.
