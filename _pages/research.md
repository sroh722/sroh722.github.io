<summary>Abstract</summary>
With the spread of global agricultural value chains, international geopolitical risks often unintentionally trigger food insecurity in bystander countries. This study explores the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on wheat supplies in South Africa and their trade diversification. Using port-level trade data, we show that South Africa, the main distribution route for South African wheat supplies, rapidly diversified its imports to mitigate geopolitical risk in the aftermath of the war. This sudden import diversification prevented the war-induced decline in average wheat imports, yet it led to an increase in the volatility of annual imports. More importantly, the import diversification contributed to more secure wheat supplies for southern African landlocked countries that were heavily reliant on border imports from South Africa. Our study highlights that sourcing diversification in a country with well-developed port infrastructure could be instrumental in stave off food insecurity in neighboring countries in times of geopolitical crises.

[Global Value Chains and Intellectual Property Right in Agricultural Trade](/files/AAEA2023_SaeraOh.pdf) \
(with Sunghun Lim and Titus Awokuse) - _A draft can be provided upon request_

<summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper examines the impact of intellectual property rights (IPR)-related trade policy on agri-food global value chains (GVCs). The study uses IPR provisions in regional trade agreements (RTAs) as a proxy for IPR-related trade policy. The empirical specification follows a gravity model, and the Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood method is employed. The paper analyzes the overall effect of IPR provisions in RTAs on average GVC trade in the agriculture and food sectors. We further explore the trade effects of IPR provisions based on their specific characteristics, utilizing the deep trade agreement data published by the World Bank. Finally, the paper investigates the effects of IPR provisions by income pair group. The empirical results indicate that average bilateral agricultural GVC trade participation decreases between members with RTAs that include IPR provisions compared to those without. However, the effects vary by the type of IPR provisions. The results suggest that an interactive effect between the two types of IPR provisions is crucial for enhancing agricultural and food GVC trade, whereas single-type IPR provisions have a negative effect. The effects are more significant in the agriculture sector compared to the food sector. Moreover, the study finds heterogeneous effects across countries' income levels.
