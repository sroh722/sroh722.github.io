ðŸ”– Related Party Trade and Gravity: Revisiting the Distance Effects
<!-- This is a single-line comment -->
> Abstract: Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are central actors in global trade, yet affiliates face two distinct export modesâ€”selling to related parties within the MNE network or to unrelated buyers at armâ€™s lengthâ€”and these modes may not respond to trade costs in the same way. Using shipment-level data from India and Mexico, we identify related-party transactions through string match of exporter and importer names and document that many affiliates engage in both types of trade. Motivated by the residual control rights literature, we develop a simple framework in which exporting a good requires coordination effort on the importerâ€™s side, and the headquartersâ€™ organizational regime influences that effort. This framework highlights a mechanism through which related-party trade may exhibit attenuated sensitivity to trade costs compared with armâ€™s-length transactions. We examine this idea through two empirical analyses, focusing specifically on distance as a proxy for trade costs. First, we show that related-party exports are less sensitive to affilate-destination distance. Second, we find evidence of a multi-layered geography of MNE trade: greater affiliateâ€“destination distance is positively associated with the probability of related-party trade, while proximity between headquarters and destination exerts a strong gravitational pull.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
With the spread of global agricultural value chains, international geopolitical risks often unintentionally trigger food insecurity in bystander countries. This study explores the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on wheat supplies in South Africa and their trade diversification. Using port-level trade data, we show that South Africa, the main distribution route for South African wheat supplies, rapidly diversified its imports to mitigate geopolitical risk in the aftermath of the war. This sudden import diversification prevented the war-induced decline in average wheat imports, yet it led to an increase in the volatility of annual imports. More importantly, the import diversification contributed to more secure wheat supplies for southern African landlocked countries that were heavily reliant on border imports from South Africa. Our study highlights that sourcing diversification in a country with well-developed port infrastructure could be instrumental in stave off food insecurity in neighboring countries in times of geopolitical crises.

## Working Paper

ðŸ”– [Global Value Chains and Intellectual Property Right in Agricultural Trade](https://sroh722.github.io/files/AAEA2023_SaeraOh.pdf) (with Sunghun Lim and Titus Awokuse) - _A draft will be provided upon request_

> Abstract: This study examines the impact of intellectual property rights (IPR)-related trade policy on agri-food global value chains (GVCs). We use IPR provisions in regional trade agreements (RTAs) as a proxy for IPR-related trade policy. The empirical specification follows a gravity model. We explore the trade effects of IPR provisions based on their specific characteristics using the deep trade agreement data published by the World Bank. Additionally, the study analyzes the effects of IPR provisions by income pair group. The results indicate that average bilateral agricultural GVC trade participation decreases between members with RTAs containing IPR provisions compared to those without them. However, the effects vary by the type of IPR provisions. The findings suggest that interactive effects between different types of IPR provisions are crucial for enhancing agricultural and food GVC trade, while single-type IPR provisions have negative effects. These effects are more pronounced in the agriculture sector compared to the food sector and vary across income levels.

ðŸ”– Trade Policy, Crop Choice, and Water Stress: Evidence from Mexican Agriculture (with Hyeseon Shin)

> Abstract: International trade can influence the crop choices of local farmers, with important implications for water use, as some crops are significantly more water-intensive than others. Yet, trade patterns do not always align with comparative advantages in water availabilityâ€”water-scarce countries may continue to export water-intensive crops, potentially worsening local water shortages. This study investigates how trade policy shapes crop selection in Mexican agriculture and evaluates its effects on local water resources. We construct an open-economy general equilibrium model with a nested crop-choice framework, which allows us to explicitly capture heterogeneous responses across different types of land to price changes resulting from trade policies or trade shocks. By assuming a complementary relationship between land and water in production technology, we can examine changes in water use under our scenarios and discuss the implications of these changes in the context of water stress and Mexicoâ€™s hydrological infrastructure investment.
